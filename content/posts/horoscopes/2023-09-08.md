### Aries{.horoheader}

*~21 March - 20 April*
{.horodate}

Today, you may find yourself yearning for adventure and excitement. However, the universe has other plans for you, dear Aries. Don't be disheartened if your exploration of new recreational activities hits a roadblock. Sometimes, the gangplank you thought was solid turns out to be made of jelly bean.


### Taurus{.horoheader}

*~21 April - 21 May*
{.horodate}

Dear Taurus, the cosmic pranksters are at it again, plotting their next big joke. But fear not, for you are not their target this time. Instead, they have set their sights on a fifth cousin of a peer of the realm. While it's fun to observe the chaos, remember to balance your independence with a sense of togetherness in your own life.


### Gemini{.horoheader}

*~22 May - 21 June*
{.horodate}

New opportunities and ventures may come knocking at your door today, Gemini. But tread carefully and embrace patience and tolerance, for not all ventures are what they seem. While that shiny investment opportunity may seem like a birdhouse filled with starry night dreams, it might just be tree bark disguised as gold.


### Cancer{.horoheader}

*~22 June - 23 July*
{.horodate}

Communication and expressiveness will be key for you today, dear Cancer. But beware of using your words to manipulate others or play mind games. Your inner strength and resilience will shine brighter if you use your voice judiciously and authentically.


### Leo{.horoheader}

*~24 July - 23 August*
{.horodate}

Forget about searching for your comedic fortune cookie message today, Leo. Instead, focus on improving your parenting skills and nurturing those around you. Embrace the joy of an ice cream parlor outing with loved ones instead of seeking laughter in fleeting jokes.


### Virgo{.horoheader}

*~24 August - 23 September*
{.horodate}

Dear Virgo, today is all about exploring new spiritual practices. Take some time to connect with your inner self and explore different paths that resonate with your soul. Remember, true enlightenment cannot be found at every train station or in every trendy crystal shop.


### Libra{.horoheader}

*~24 September - 23 October*
{.horodate}

Finding your career path might feel like searching for a needle in a moist haystack today, Libra. But don't let that dishearten you. Trust in the journey and embrace the process of exploring new possibilities. Eventually, you'll find the path that leads you to your true calling.


### Scorpio{.horoheader}

*~24 October - 22 November*
{.horodate}

Today, the planets are obsessively charting the laugh-o-meter, but beware, dear Scorpio. Not all laughter is genuine, and not all jokes are meant to bring joy. Look beyond the surface humor and seek authenticity in your interactions. The real treasure lies in connecting with others on a deeper level.


### Sagittarius{.horoheader}

*~23 November - 21 December*
{.horodate}

Dear Sagittarius, let go of the need for external validation and embrace your inner strength. Today is all about finding resilience within yourself and tapping into your personal power. Remember, no water bottle can quench your thirst for self-discovery and growth.


### Capricorn{.horoheader}

*~22 December - 20 January*
{.horodate}

While you may be eager to explore new career paths, Capricorn, it's important to approach this journey with caution and pragmatism. Don't be disheartened if finding the perfect fit takes time. Like an architect building a sturdy foundation, take each step judiciously and create a career that stands tall.


### Aquarius{.horoheader}

*~21 January - 19 February*
{.horodate}

Today, you may feel compelled to examine the world through a comedic lens, Aquarius. But amidst the search for humorous treasures, don't forget to nourish your inner being. Take a break from seeking laughter and spend some time savoring the tranquility of a starry night sky.


### Pisces{.horoheader}

*~20 February - 20 March*
{.horodate}

Finding balance in your relationships is key today, Pisces. Take time to reflect on how you can improve your connections with loved ones and bring harmony into your life. Remember, a solid bond isn't built on superficial gestures; it's nurtured with genuine love and a willingness to listen.
